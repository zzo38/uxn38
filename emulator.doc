=== Command-line switches ===

-D
  Use double buffering for the display.

-F
  Start in full screen mode.

-N
  Tells the window manager to omit the frame.

-Q
  Disable the mouse initially (it can still be enabled at run time).

-T year.month.day.hours.minutes.seconds.wday.yday.yday.isdst
  Use a fixed value for the date/time, by numbers with dots in between. In
  this case, it will read the same values from the date/time device each
  time it is read. If you put less numbers than expected, then zero will
  be used for the remaining values; however, some programs will use these
  values to seed a random number generator and will not work correctly if
  they are zero.

-Y
  Enable file system access including writing.

-Z
  Use UTC instead of local time. (Has no effect in combination with -T.)

-d
  Enable some debugging features. (Some will work even without this.)

-h #
  Set default screen height.

-i
  Hide the system mouse cursor. (The Uxn program might still draw its own
  mouse cursor, which most do.)

-n
  Disable GUI. This switch is required in order to read stdin; without it,
  stdin cannot be read (although command-line arguments still work).

-p #
  Select the palette. Valid palette numbers are 0 to 7, where 7 is the
  default setting and means that the running Uxn program can set colours.

-q
  Disable standard I/O.

-t #
  Set the frame rate, in milliseconds per frame.

-w #
  Set default screen width.

-y
  Enable read-only file system access.

-z #
  Set zoom level.


=== Function keys ===

F1
  Advance one frame, even if paused.

F3
  Toggle the mouse mode. When the mouse mode is disabled, the mouse device
  does not work; the mouse vector is not called and the mouse coordinates
  and button state is not updated.

F4
  Change which graphics layers are displayed. Either both layers, or only
  foreground or only background.

F5
  Redraw screen. If the right shift key is also pushed, then also sends
  some debug output to stderr.

F6 / F7
  Palette selection.

F9
  Restart.

F10
  Quit.

PAUSE
  Pause/unpause VM.

Some programs use shortcut keys with control and letters. This does not
work in this program; therefore, END is an alias for the joypad A button
(the left control key also corresponds to the joypad A button, but if used
together with letter keys, will enter control characters instead).

=== Command-line switches ===

-D
  Use double buffering for the display.

-F
  Start in full screen mode.

-I
  Use a separate thread to read from stdin.

-J #
  Set joystick mode. See the below section about joystick for details.

-N
  Tells the window manager to omit the frame.

-Q
  Disable the mouse initially (it can still be enabled at run time).

-S
  Disallow the uxn program to change the screen size.

-T year.month.day.hours.minutes.seconds.wday.yday.yday.isdst
  Use a fixed value for the date/time, by numbers with dots in between. In
  this case, it will read the same values from the date/time device each
  time it is read. If you put less numbers than expected, then zero will
  be used for the remaining values; however, some programs will use these
  values to seed a random number generator and will not work correctly if
  they are zero.

-Y
  Enable file system access including writing.

-Z
  Use UTC instead of local time. (Has no effect in combination with -T.)

-a #
  Set audio. See the below section about audio for details. If both -a and
  -n switches are used, then audio data is written to stdout (it is signed
  16-bits big-endian).

-d
  Enable some debugging features. (Some will work even without this.)

-h #
  Set default screen height.

-i
  Hide the system mouse cursor. (The Uxn program might still draw its own
  mouse cursor, which most do.)

-j
  Enable key repeat for joypad emulation.

-n
  Disable GUI. Either this switch or -I is required in order to read stdin.
  If neither -n nor -I is specified, then stdin cannot be read (although
  command-line arguments can still be read).

-p #
  Select the palette. Valid palette numbers are 0 to 7, where 7 is the
  default setting and means that the running Uxn program can set colours.

-q
  Disable standard I/O.

-s #
  Define scroll amount.

-t #
  Set the frame rate, in milliseconds per frame.

-w #
  Set default screen width.

-x
  Enable nonstandard features.

-y
  Enable read-only file system access.

-z #
  Set zoom level.


=== Function keys ===

F1
  Advance one frame, even if paused.

F2
  Mute/unmute audio.

F3
  Toggle the mouse mode. When the mouse mode is disabled, the mouse device
  does not work; the mouse vector is not called and the mouse coordinates
  and button state is not updated.

F4
  Change which graphics layers are displayed. Either both layers, or only
  foreground or only background.

F5
  Redraw screen. If the right shift key is also pushed, then also sends
  some debug output to stderr.

F6 / F7
  Palette selection.

F8
  Debug menu.

F9
  Restart.

F10
  Quit.

PAUSE
  Pause/unpause VM.

PAGE-UP / PAGE-DOWN
  Scroll up/down.

Some programs use shortcut keys with control and letters. This does not
work in this program; therefore, END is an alias for the joypad A button
(the left control key also corresponds to the joypad A button, but if used
together with letter keys, will enter control characters instead).


=== Audio ===

The audio setting consists of a sequence of letters and numbers; each item
is one letter "a" to "z" followed by a number of any number of digits. (It
can optionally have - at first for negative numbers, although most options
cannot use negative numbers.)

b = Buffer size.

c = Number of output channels, which can be 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo).

e = Envelope speed. If not specified, then it is fifteenths of seconds.

m = If set to 1, then audio is initially muted. (This option is ignored if
the -n switch is used.)

n = Transpose amount.

r = Sample rate in hertz. Normally, this setting is also the sample rate
for middle C.

v = Output volume from 0 to 273. If not all of the four VM audio channels
are being used, then this number may be set higher than 273.

(Currently there is not the setting of interpolation, filter, etc.)


=== Joystick ===

The joystick parameter can be ? to list joysticks, or ? and a number to
display details about that joystick, or it can be the below specification
in order to configure joysticks.

The first part is numbers with commas in between, being the joystick ID
numbers (as shown by the ? list); up to four numbers can be specified. If
a number is omitted, then that slot is not used.

After the first part is a forward slash, and then the mapping (all
joysticks must use an identical mapping). Each item is a letter and then
a number, with no delimiters in between. The letters can be:

A B S T U D L R
  Specify which joystick button to map to the uxn joypad button;
  respectively, A, B, SELECT, START, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Only the first
  128 buttons can be mapped.

X Y x y
  Specify which axis to use as the X and Y axis. Uppercase letters means
  that axis is reversed; do not specify both "X" and "x", and do not
  specify both "Y" and "y".

s
  Set sensitivity, from 1 to 32767. Higher numbers mean the joystick must
  be moved more in order to register, while lower numbers means that it
  does not need to moved much in order to be registered.

H h I i
  Specify the hat number to use. Different letters correspond to different
  orientations (specify only up to one of these letters, not all of them).
  "h" is normal, "H" is reverse, "I" and "i" are sideways.


=== Nonstandard features ===

The -x switch enables the following nonstandard features, which include
some nonstandard expansion commands and nonstandard ports. They should not
be used in portable programs until they become standardized, though (you
can discuss in the mailing list of Uxn; changes may also be made in future,
possibly as a result of the discussions).

If any such features listed below become standardized in future, then their
documentation will be moved to the varvara.doc file, and the -x switch will
no longer be required in order to use them.

The list of expansion commands below uses > for output parameters (from the
emulator to the program), ? for parameters that may be input and/or output,
* for 16-bit values, and % for values of lengths other than 8-bits or
16-bits or if they are of a variable length.

02 >pages*
  Tells number of expanded memory pages. (This is the maximum valid value
  for src_page and dst_page in expanded memory operations.)

03 device_id uuid% >version ?extra%
  Loads a nonstandard device. The device ID is the starting port number to
  use, which must be nonzero and must be a multiple of sixteen; some
  implementations may impose further restrictions. The UUID is sixteen
  bytes long. The version is zero if not implemented or nonzero if it is
  implemented (the specific value is defined by the specification of that
  extension). The extra data depends on the extension, and may be unused
  (if it is unknown or unused, then the emulator MUST ignore it and not
  make changes to that data).

Nonstandard ports of devices are:

17
  Indicates type of input in the low nybble. The high bit is set if it
  should execute the standard I/O vector for EOF and for the end of
  command-line arguments (for compatibility, normally it will not do
  this). The types of input are:
   0 = Standard input
   1 = EOF (*)
   2 = Command-line argument text
   3 = Delimiter of command-line arguments
   4 = End of command-line arguments (*)

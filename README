This project is available as both a fossil reopsitory and a git repository;
the fossil is the main one. (Note that pull requests from GitHub cannot be
merged, although you are free to make them, but I will just have to add
them manually instead if I accept the contribution (but I can list you as
a coauthor, if you wish).)

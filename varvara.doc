This document describes the devices of Uxn virtual machine.

The high nybble of the port number selects one of the following devices:
  0 = System
  1 = Standard I/O
  2 = Screen
  3 = Audio
  4 = Audio
  5 = Audio
  6 = Audio
  7 = MIDI
  8 = Keyboard/joypad
  9 = Mouse
  A = File
  B = File
  C = Date/time
  D = Implementation dependent
  E = Implementation dependent
  F = Implementation dependent

Note that there are four audio channels, and two files can be opened at
the same time.

In the below lists, asterisks indicate 16-bit ports.


=== System ===

00 = Vector *
02 = Expansion *
04 = Title *
06 = Metadata *
08 = Colours (red) *
0A = Colours (green) *
0C = Colours (blue) *
0E = Debug
0F = Quit

Some implementations call the system vector if an error occurs.

Writing an address to the expansion port will execute an expansion
operation, which is a record stored at that address; the first byte of
that data is the operation code, and the rest are the arguments. See the
below list of expansion operations.

The title port points to a null-terminated ASCII string which may be used
as the window title (if supported by the emulator).

The colours control the colours of the display, where the high nybble of
each controls the value for colour index 0, and the low nybble of each
controls the value for colour index 3.

Writing nonzero to the debug port will display some debug info or break
into the debugger; the exact meaning is implementation-dependent, but it
is used for debugging functions.

Writing nonzero to the quit port terminates the program; the low seven bits
of the number written is the exit code (if exit code is meaningful for the
operating system that it is running on) (writing 0x80 exits with code 0
which means successful).

(In previous versions of this specification, port 02 is the data stack
port and port 03 is the return stack port. The data stack and return stack
ports have a different meaning in different implementations, and probably
should not be used by most programs.)


=== Standard I/O ===

10 = Vector *
12 = Input
17 = Type
18 = Output
19 = Error

Each byte of input is received from stdin will result in setting the input
port to the byte read and calls the vector. Immediately after the first
BRK (and before any other events), any command-line arguments are also
sent in this way as though each one is a line of input from stdin
terminated by a line feed.

On input, the type port is set to the type of input, where:
  1 = stdin
  2 = command-line argument text
  3 = line break after command-line argument, other than the final one
  4 = line break after the final command-line argument

During the startup (call to 0x0100), the type port will be 1 if there are
any command-line arguments and 0 if there are no arguments.

Writing to the output and error ports write a byte to stdout or stderr.


=== Screen ===

20 = Vector *
22 = Width *
24 = Height *
26 = Auto
28 = X *
2A = Y *
2C = Sprite address *
2E = Pixel command
2F = Sprite command

The screen has two layers (background and foreground), and can display four
colours. If the foreground colour is zero then the background is displayed.

The vector is called during each video frame (60 frames per second).

Writing the width and height will change the window size if possible (some
implementations might not be able to do so), and should clear the screen.
(If you read back then you can find the actual width/height.)

The auto port works as follows:
  bit7-bit4 = One less than number of sprites to draw
  bit3 = Unused (should be clear)
  bit2 = Address
  bit1 = Y
  bit0 = X

Writing to the pixel command port will change the pixel at the specified
coordinates, and will automatically increment X and/or Y if the
corresponding bits of the auto port are set. The bits of pixel port are:
  bit7 = Set for fill mode
  bit6 = Set for foreground layer, clear for background layer
  bit5-bit4 = Specify corner for fill mode (unused if not fill mode)
  bit3-bit2 = Unused (should be clear)
  bit1-bit0 = Colour

If fill mode is set, then it will fill a part of the screen, in a rectangle
from the specified X and Y coordinates to one of the corners of the screen.
In this case, the X and Y are not automatically incremented. The corners of
the screen are numbered as follows:
  3 2
  1 0

Writing to the sprite command port will draw one or more sprites. The bits
are as follows:
  bit7 = Set for 2bpp sprites, clear for 1bpp
  bit6 = Set for foreground layer, clear for background layer
  bit5 = Vertical flip
  bit4 = Horizontal flip
  bit3-bit0 = Colour

(TODO: explain sprites better)


=== Audio ===

30 = Vector *
32 = Position *
33 = Output
38 = Envelope *
3A = Length *
3C = Address *
3E = Volume
3F = Pitch

Each such device is one audio channel.

The envelope can be zero for no envelope, or can be nonzero for a ADSR
envelope where the four nybbles (high to low) are the time of each part
of the envelope, in fifteenths of a second. The envelope is as follows:
  0% -A- 100% -D- 50% -S- 50% -R- 0%

The length is the length of the sample data (in bytes), and the address
is the address of the sample data. The sample format is unsigned 8-bits.

Volume has the high nybble for the left speaker and low nybble for the
right speaker, where fifteen is the maximum volume and zero is silence.

Writing to the pitch port will read all parameters and will start a new
note playing. The high bit is set to disable looping, or clear to enable
looping (until the envelope ends, if there is any). The low 7-bits are a
MIDI note number (0x3C for middle C).

If the length is greater than 256 bytes, then it is assumed to have a
sample rate of 44100 Hz for middle C (if a different note number is
specified, then it will be played at a different speed). If the length
is less than 256 then it is assumed to be one cycle of a middle C note.

Vector is called when a note ends, and the position and output ports are
used to read back the status.


=== MIDI ===

This does not seem to be fully defined at this time (and the existing
design is not very good in my opinion).


=== Keyboard/joypad ===

80 = Vector *
82 = Joypad
83 = Key
85 = Player 2
86 = Player 3
87 = Player 4

The vector is called if a key is pushed, or if any button on the joypad is
pushed or released.

The joypad byte has bits as follows:
  bit7 = Right
  bit6 = Left
  bit5 = Down
  bit4 = Up
  bit3 = Start (or home)
  bit2 = Select (or left shift)
  bit1 = B (or left alt)
  bit0 = A (or left control)

The key is the ASCII code of the key pushed.


=== Mouse ===

90 = Vector *
92 = X *
94 = Y *
96 = Buttons
9A = Scroll X *
9C = Scroll Y *

The vector is called when the mouse is moved or if any mouse buttons are
pushed or released.

The scroll amounts are signed 16-bit numbers.


=== Files ===

A2 = Number of bytes transferred *
A4 = Stat (address to store data) *
A6 = Delete
A7 = Append
A8 = Address of file name *
AA = Maximum number of bytes to transfer *
AC = Read (address to store data) *
AE = Write (address to take data from) *

If the address of a null-terminated file name is written to that port,
then the device is reset and it remembers the file name (so the memory
used to store it can be reused afterward).

All other operations need the maximum length in that port, and then
write the address of the data to the stat/read/write port. The 0xA2 port
(or 0xB2 for the second file) will then have the number of bytes which
have been successfully transferred, or zero if it is not successful.

If there are multiple reads without other operations (including setting
the file name) in between, or multiple writes without other operations
(including setting the file name) in between, then it will continue from
where it left off in the file; otherwise it starts from the beginning.

For the first write, it will truncate the file if the append byte is
zero, or will start writing at the end of the file if the append byte
is nonzero.

Reading from either of the read ports will read a single byte from the
file (in this case, the address and max number of bytes is ignored). In
this case, you should write to both 0xAB and 0xAC if you want to do a
long read since if you write to only 0xAC then the address is undefined.

Stat will result in a directory entry for the current file being written
to the specified address (or nothing if it does not fit). The format of
a directory entry is four characters being its size in lowercase
hexadecimal with leading zeros, or ???? if it is bigger than 64K, or ----
if it is a subdirectory; after that is a space, and then the file name,
and then a line feed.

If the current file is a directory, then reading from it will read the
directory entries in the same format as above. Only full entries can be
read; you cannot read partial entries. Only as many full entries as will
fit in the allowed space will be retrieved.


=== Date/time ===

C0 = Year *
C2 = Month (zero-based)
C3 = Day of month (one-based)
C4 = Hours
C5 = Minutes
C6 = Seconds
C7 = Day of the week (0=Sunday)
C8 = Day of the year *
CA = Daylight saving time

Some programs use this device to seed a random number generator, and
will not work correctly if these values are all zero.


=== Expansion ===

01 length* src_page* src_addr* dst_page* dst_addr*
  Allows accessing expanded memory.
